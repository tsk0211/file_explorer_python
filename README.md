File explorer app created using OOPs and pythons GUI library Tkinter.

I have used the classic python GUI Tkinter library to create a real-time working file explorer.
This is made for learning purposes of Object Oriented Programming.
Each component in the GUI is a class object and has seperate properties.
You can perform CRUD operations on windows PC and it provides dynamic file explorer pop-ups.

This was my study time project so it does not have flashy features but does contain high level abstaction and management of many function calls.
Project uses python's OS library to handle operations with command-line of Windows.
It only works on Windows. We can integrate it for many more platforms.
It also has copy, paste and cut features. Which give a real feeling of using Windows file explorer.

I completed it during my 1st year of computer engineering.
